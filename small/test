Biology is the science that studies life , and living things , and the evolution of life .
Living things include animals , plants , fungi ( such as mushrooms ) , and microorganisms such as bacteria and archaea .
The term 'biology ' is relatively modern .
It was introduced in 1799 by a physician , Thomas Beddoes .
People who study biology are called biologists .
Biology looks at how animals and other living things behave and work , and what they are like .
Biology also studies how organisms react with each other and the environment .
It has existed as a science for about 200 years , and was preceded by natural history .
Biology has many research fields and branches .
Like all sciences , biology uses the scientific method .
This means that biologists must be able to show evidence for their ideas and that other biologists must be able to test the ideas for themselves .
Biology attempts to answer questions such as :
Modern biology is influenced by evolution , which answers the question : `` How has the living world come to be as it is ? ''
The word `` biology '' comes from the Greek word `` βίος '' ( `` bios '' ) , `` life '' , and the suffix `` -λογία '' ( `` logia '' ) , `` study of '' .
Botany
Botany is the study of plants .
It is a science .
It is a branch of biology , and is also called plant biology .
It is sometimes called phytology .
Scientists who study botany are called botanists .
They study how plants work .
Belgium
Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium , is a federal state in Western Europe .
Belgium has an area of .
Around 11 million people live in Belgium .
It is a founding member of the European Union and is home to its headquarters .
The capital city of Belgium is Brussels , where the European Union , NATO and other famous organisations are based .
There are three regions in Belgium :
The population is about 60 % Dutch-speaking , 39 % French-speaking , and 1 % German-speaking ( the so-called `` Deutschbelgier '' ) .
To look after all these groups , Belgium has a complicated system of government .
The name 'Belgium ' comes from `` Gallia Belgica '' .
This was a Roman province in the northernmost part of Gaul .
Before Roman invasion in 100 BC , the `` Belgae '' , a mix of Celtic and Germanic peoples , lived there .
The Germanic Frankish tribes during the 5th century brought the area under the rule of the Merovingian kings .
A slow shift of power during the 8th century led the kingdom of the Franks to change into the Carolingian Empire .
The Treaty of Verdun in 843 divided the region into Middle and West Francia .
They were vassals either of the King of France or of the Holy Roman Emperor .
Many of these fiefdoms were united in the Burgundian Netherlands of the 14th and 15th centuries .
The Eighty Years ' War ( 1568–1648 ) divided the Low Countries into the northern United Provinces and the Southern Netherlands .
Southern Netherlands were ruled by the Spanish and the Austrian Habsburgs .
This made up most of modern Belgium .
After the , the Low Countries were added into the French First Republic .
This ended Austrian rule in the area .
Adding back the Low Countries formed the United Kingdom of the Netherlands .
This happened at the end of the First French Empire in 1815 .
The Belgian Revolution was in 1830 .
Leopold I became king on 1831 .
This is now celebrated as Belgium 's National Day .
The Berlin Conference of 1885 gave control of the Congo Free State to King Leopold II .
This was for him personally and not for the country of Belgium .
Starting in about 1900 many people did not like how he treated the Congolese people .
In 1908 the Belgian state took control of the colony .
It was then called the Belgian Congo .
Germany invaded Belgium in 1914 .
This was part of World War I .
The opening months of the war were very bad in Belgium .
During the war Belgium took over the of Ruanda-Urundi ( modern day Rwanda and Burundi ) .
After the First World War , the Prussian districts of Eupen and Malmedy were added into Belgium in 1925 .
The country was again invaded by Germany in 1940 and under German control until 1944 .
After World War II , the people made king Leopold III leave his throne in 1951 .
This is because they thought he helped the Germans .
In 1960 the Belgian Congo stopped being under Belgian rule .
Two years later Ruanda-Urundi also became free .
Belgium joined NATO as a founding member .
Since 1993 , Belgium is a federal state , divided into three regions and three communities .
Regions :
Communities :
It has a system of government known as a constitutional monarchy , meaning that it has a monarch , but that the monarch does not rule the country , and that a government is elected democratically .
Belgium has had its own monarchy since 1831 .
King Albert II left the throne on July 21 , 2013 and the current king is Philippe .
In Belgium , the government is elected .
Between mid-2010 and late 2011 , after no clear result in the election , Belgium had no official government , until Elio Di Rupo became Prime Minister .
Flanders and Wallonia both also have their own regional governments , and there is a notable independence movement in Flanders .
Charles Michel is currently the Prime Minister .
Belgium is next to France , Germany , Luxembourg and the Netherlands .
Its total area is 33,990 square kilometers .
The land area alone is 30,528 km² .
Belgium has three main geographical regions .
The coastal plain is in the north-west .
The central plateau are part of the Anglo-Belgian Basin .
The Ardennes uplands are in the south-east .
The Paris Basin reaches a small fourth area at Belgium 's southernmost tip , Belgian Lorraine .
The coastal plain is mostly sand dunes and polders .
Further inland is a smooth , slowly rising landscape .
There are fertile valleys .
The hills have many forests .
The plateaus of the Ardennes are more rough and rocky .
They have caves and small , narrow valleys .
Signal de Botrange is the country 's highest point at 694 metres ( 2,277 ft ) .
Belgium is divided into three Regions .
Flanders and Wallonia are divided into provinces .
The third Region , Brussels is not part of any province .
The Belgian Armed Forces have about 46,000 active troops .
In 2009 the yearly defence budget was $ 6 billion .
There are four parts : Belgian Land Component , or the Army ; Belgian Air Component , or the Air Force ; Belgian Naval Component , or the Navy ; Belgian Medical Component .
Adding to science and technology has happened throughout the country 's history .
cartographer Gerardus Mercator , anatomist Andreas Vesalius , herbalist Rembert Dodoens and mathematician Simon Stevin are among the most influential scientists .
Chemist Ernest Solvay and engineer Zenobe Gramme gave their names to the Solvay process and the Gramme dynamo in the 1860s .
Bakelite was formed in 1907–1909 by Leo Baekeland .
A major addition to science was also due to a Belgian , Georges Lemaître .
He is the one who made the Big Bang theory of the start of the universe in 1927 .
Three Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine were awarded to Belgians : Jules Bordet in 1919 , Corneille Heymans in 1938 and Albert Claude together with Christian De Duve in 1974 .
Ilya Prigogine was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977 .
Two Belgian mathematicians have been awarded the Fields Medal : Pierre Deligne in 1978 and Jean Bourgain in 1994 .
In February 2014 , Belgium became the first country in the world to legalize euthanasia without any age limits .
There have been many additions to painting and architecture .
Several examples of major architectural places in Belgium belong to UNESCO 's World Heritage List .
In the 15th century the religious paintings of Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden were important .
The 16th century had more styles such as Peter Breughel 's landscape paintings and Lambert Lombard 's showing of the antique .
The style of Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck was strong in the early 17th century in the Southern Netherlands .
During the 19th and 20th centuries many original romantic , expressionist and surrealist Belgian painters started .
These include James Ensor and other artists in the Les XX group , Constant Permeke , Paul Delvaux and René Magritte .
The sculptor Panamarenko is still a remarkable figure in contemporary art .
The artist Jan Fabre and the painter Luc Tuymans are other internationally known figures in contemporary art .

Brazil
Brazil ( officially called Federative Republic of Brazil ; how to say : ) is a country in South America .
It is the world 's fifth largest country .
The country has about 209 million people .
The capital of Brazil is Brasília .
Brazil was named after brazilwood , which is a tree that once grew very well along the Brazilian coast .
The first people to come to Brazil came around 9,000 B.C .
That group of people is often called the South American Indians and probably came from North America .
Some of them were hunters and gatherers , but others were farmers .
Pedro Álvares Cabral was the first European to see Brazil .
He saw it in 1500 .
He was from Portugal and the Portuguese government claimed Brazil .
Soon , explorers explored the whole coastline of Brazil and colonies were set up .
In the late 1500s and early 1600s , the Dutch and the French tried to take land in Brazil .
Brazilians started moving inland further than the Treaty of Tordesillas said they could .
This caused some fights with the Spaniards ( people from Spain ) and native people in the area .
In 1822 , Brazil claimed to be its own country and not a part of Portugal anymore .
Soon there was civil war .
But the emperor Pedro II improved the economy , and in 1888 , he freed the slaves .
In 1889 , there was a military coup , and Pedro II had to leave the country .
In 1889 , Brazil became a republic .
It was not very democratic , because the only people who could vote were people who owned land .
There were some uprisings in the 1920s because some people thought the government was unfairly helping coffee growers .
Brazil joined the Allies during World War II .
During the 1960s , the leader Castelo Branco made the government like a dictatorship .
Since then , the country has become more democratic , but some people feel that there are still big problems in health , education , crime , poverty and social inequality .
In September 2016 , then-president Dilma Rousseff was removed from office because of impeachment .
Most people in Brazil speak Portuguese .
Brazil is the only country in South America that speaks Portuguese .
Some people in Brazil speak German dialects .
That came from German immigrants .
2 % of Brazilians speak German as their first language .
Yiddish is spoken by the elders of the Jewish community .
Other people in Brazil speak their ancestors ' languages like Italian , Japanese , Polish , Ukrainian , French , Russian , Lithuanian , Chinese , Dutch and Korean .
Spanish or `` Portunhol '' , a mix of Portuguese and Castilian ( Spanish ) is spoken at some of the borders .
Indigenous languages as Guarani and Aymará are the first languages of a small number of Brazilians .
Brazil has the world 's largest rainforest , the Amazon Rainforest .
It makes up 40 % of the country 's land area .
Brazil also has other types of land , including a type of savanna called `` cerrado '' , and a dry plant region named `` caatinga '' .
The most important cities are Brasília ( the capital ) , Belém , Belo Horizonte , Curitiba , Florianópolis , Fortaleza , Goiânia , Manaus , Porto Alegre , Recife , Rio de Janeiro , Salvador , São Paulo ( the biggest city ) and Vitória .
Other cities are at List of largest cities in Brazil .
Brazil is divided into 26 states plus the Federal District in five regions ( north , south , northeast , southeast and centre-west ) :
The country is the fifth largest in the world by area .
It is known for its many rainforests and jungles .
It is next to every country in South America except Chile and Ecuador .
The name Brazil comes from a tree named brazilwood .
Brazil is the largest country in South America and fifth largest in the world .
Its people are called Brazilians or Brasileiros ( In Portuguese ) .
The people include citizens of Portuguese or other European descent who mainly live in the South and Southeast , Africans , Native Americans , Arabs , Gypsies and people of Mixed ancestry .
Brazil also has the largest Japanese community outside Japan .
Other East Asians follow the Japanese group.The Amazon River flows through Brazil , it is the 2nd longest river in the world ( after the Nile ) .The current President of Brazil is Jair Messias Bolsonaro , also known as Bolsonaro..
Two major sporting events were held in Brazil recently : the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
Chemistry
Chemistry is a branch of science that deals with chemical elements and compounds , and how these things work together and change .
Before 1600 , people studied substances to figure out how to do things such as turn lead into gold , but no one managed to do that .
This was called alchemy .
After 1600 , using the scientific method alchemists became chemists .
Chemists separated the air into many parts and isolated the noble gases from it .
They also processed special minerals from a mine in Sweden to get rare earth metals .
Radioactivity was also discovered .
Today chemists have discovered 118 different elements .
Some are very common , like oxygen .
Many are very rare and expensive , like platinum .
Some can not be found on earth and can only be made in labs , like rutherfordium .
Since the 1920s , the increased understanding of physics has changed chemists ' theories about chemical reactions .
With smaller and faster computers , chemists have built better tools for analyzing substances .
These tools have been sent to study chemicals on Mars .
Police also use those tools to study evidence from crime scenes .
There are several types of chemistry .
Analytical chemistry looks at which chemicals are in things .
For example , looking at how much arsenic is in food .
Organic chemistry looks at things that have carbon in them .
For example , making acetylene .
Inorganic chemistry looks at things that do not have carbon in them .
One example is making an integrated circuit .
A large area of chemistry is polymer chemistry .
This looks at plastics .
One example is making nylon .
Because plastics are made of carbon , polymer chemistry is part of organic chemistry .
Another area is biochemistry .
This looks at the chemistry of living things .
An example would be seeing how arsenic poisons people .
Biochemistry is also part of organic chemistry .
There are many other small branches of chemistry .
The basic unit of an element is called an atom .
An atom is the smallest building block that you can cut an element into without the element breaking down ( turning into a lighter element , for example through nuclear fission or radioactive decay ) .
A chemical compound is a substance made up of two or more elements .
In a compound , two or more atoms are joined together to form a molecule .
The tiniest speck of dust or drop of liquid , that one can see is made up of many millions or billions of these molecules .
Mixtures are substances where chemicals are mixed but not reacted .
An example would be mixing sand and salt .
This can be undone again to produce salt and sand separately .
Chemical compounds are changed by a chemical reaction .
An example would be heating sodium bicarbonate , common baking soda .
It will make water , carbon dioxide , and sodium carbonate .
This reaction can not be undone .
One very important concept in chemistry is that different atoms interact with one another in very specific proportions .
For example , two hydrogen atoms interacting with one oxygen atom lead to the water molecule , HO .
This relationship is known as the `` Law of constant proportions '' and leads to the idea of `` stoichiometry '' , a term that refers to the ratios of different atoms in chemical compounds .
For example , in water , there are always exactly 2 hydrogen atoms to 1 oxygen atom .
In carbon dioxide , there are exactly 2 oxygen atoms for 1 carbon atom .
These relationships are described using chemical formulas such as HO ( two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom ) and CO ( one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms ) .
Because atoms of different elements react with one another in very specific proportions but atoms of different elements have different weights , chemists often describe the amount of different elements and compounds in terms of the number of `` moles '' .
A `` mole '' of any element contains the same number of atoms : 602,214,150,000,000,000,000,000 atoms .
The atomic mass of an element can be used to see how much of the element makes a mole .
For example , the atomic mass of copper is about 63.55 .
That means about 63.55 grams of copper metal has a mole of atoms .
The atomic mass of chlorine is about 35.45 .
That means 35.45 grams of chlorine has a mole of atoms in it .
Moles can be used to see how many molecules are in chemical compounds , too .
Copper ( II ) chloride is an example .
CuCl is its chemical formula .
There is one copper atom ( 63.55 ) and two chlorine atoms ( 35.45 · 2 = 70.90 ) .
Add all the molar masses of the elements together to get the molar mass of the chemical compound ( 63.55 + 70.90 = 134.45 ) .
That means in 134.45 grams of copper ( II ) chloride , there is one mole of copper ( II ) chloride molecules .
This concept is used to calculate how much chemicals are needed in a chemical reaction if no reactants ( chemicals that are reacted ) should be left .
If too much reactant is used , there will be some reactants left in the chemical reaction .
Acids and bases are common chemicals .
Acids release H ions when in water , and bases release OH ions when in water .
Acids can react with bases .
The H ion is taken from the acid by the base .
This makes water , HO .
A salt is also made when an acid and a base react together .
An example would be reacting hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) and sodium hydroxide ( NaOH ) .
Hydrochloric acid releases H and Cl ions in water .
The base releases Na and OH ions .
The H and the OH react to make water .
There is a solution of sodium chloride ( NaCl ) left .
Sodium chloride is a salt .
Chemistry is very useful in everyday life and makes up the foundation of many branches of science .
Most objects are made by chemists ( people who do chemistry ) .
Chemists are constantly working to find new and useful substances .
Chemists make new drugs and materials like paints that we use every day .
Many chemicals are harmless , but there are some chemicals that are dangerous .
For example , mercury ( II ) chloride is very toxic .
Chromates can cause cancer .
Tin ( II ) chloride pollutes water easily .
Hydrochloric acid can cause bad burns .
Some chemicals like hydrogen can explode or catch fire .
To stay safe , chemists experiment with chemicals in a chemical lab .
They use special equipment and clothing to do reactions and keep the chemicals contained .
The chemicals used in drugs and in things like bleach have been tested to make sure they are safe if used correctly .

Computer science
Computer science is the study of manipulating , managing , transforming and encoding information .
There are many different areas in computer science .
Some areas consider problems in an abstract manner , while some need special machines , called computers .
A person who works with computers will often need mathematics , science , and logic in order to design and work with computers .
This is so that they can find new and easier ways to do things , and the way to approach problems with this information .
Computers can do some things easily ( for example : simple math , or sorting out a list of names from A-to-Z ) .
But computers can not answer questions when there is not enough information , or when there is no real answer .
Also , computers may take too much time to finish long tasks .
Algorithms are a specific set of instructions or steps on how to complete a task .
For example , a computer scientist wants to sort playing cards .
There are many ways to sort them - by suits ( diamonds , clubs , hearts , and spades ) or by numbers ( 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , Jack , Queen , King , and Ace ) .
By deciding on a set of steps to sort the cards , the scientist has created an algorithm .
The scientist then needs to test whether this algorithm works .
This shows how well and how fast the algorithm sorts cards .
A simple but slow algorithm is : drop the cards , pick them up , and check whether they are sorted .
If they are not , do it again .
This method will work , but it will take a very long time .
A better algorithm is : find the first card with the smallest suit and smallest number ( 2 of diamonds ) , and place it at the start .
After this , look for the second card , and so on .
This algorithm is much faster , and does not need much space .
This sorting algorithm is called selection sort .
Ada Lovelace wrote the first computer algorithm in 1843 , for a computer that was never finished .
Computers began during World War II .
Computer science separated from the other sciences during the 1960s and 1970s .
Now , computer science has its own methods , and has its own technical terms .
It is related to electrical engineering , mathematics , and language science .
Computer science looks at the theoretical parts of computers .
Computer engineering looks at the physical parts of computers ( hardware ) .
Software engineering looks at the use of computer programs and how to make them .
Computer
A computer is a machine that accepts data as input , processes that data using programs , and outputs the processed data as information .
Many computers can store and retrieve information using hard drives .
Computers can be connected together to form networks , allowing connected computers to communicate with each other .
The two principal characteristics of a computer are : It responds to a specific instruction set in a well-defined manner and it can execute a prerecorded list of instructions call a program .
There are four main processing steps in a computer : inputting , storage , outputting and processing .
Modern computers can do billions of calculations in a second .
Being able to calculate many times per second allows modern computers to multitask , which means they can do many different tasks at the same time .
Computers do many different jobs where automation is useful .
Some examples are controlling traffic lights , vehicle computers , security systems , washing machines and digital televisions .
Computers can be designed to do almost anything with information .
Computers are used to control large and small machines which in the past were controlled by humans .
Most people have used a personal computer in their home or at work .
They are used for things such as calculation , listening to music , reading the news , writing etc .
Modern computers are electronic computer hardware .
They do mathematical arithmetic very quickly but computers do not really `` think '' .
They only follow the instructions in their software programs .
The software uses the hardware when the user gives it instructions , and gives useful output .
Humans control computers with user interfaces .
Input devices include keyboards , computer mice , buttons , and touch screens .
Some computers can also be controlled with voice commands , hand gestures or even brain signals through electrodes implanted in the brain or along nerves .
Computer programs are designed or written by computer programmers .
A few programmers write programs in the computer 's own language called machine code .
Most programs are written using a programming language like C++ , Java , and Fortran .
These programming languages are more like the language with which one talks and writes every day .
The compiler translates the user 's instructions into binary code ( machine code ) that the computer will understand and do what is needed .
Most humans have a problem with math .
To show this , try doing 584 × 3,220 in your head .
It is hard to remember all the steps !
People made tools to help them remember where they were in a math problem .
The other problem people have is that they have to do the same problem over and over and over again .
A cashier had to make change every day in her head or with a piece of paper .
That took a lot of time and made mistakes .
So , people made calculators that did those same things over and over .
This part of computer history is called the `` history of automated calculation , '' which is a fancy phrase for `` the history of machines that make it easy for me to do this same math problem over and over without making mistakes . ''
The abacus , the slide rule , the astrolabe and the Antikythera mechanism ( which dates from about 150-100 BC ) are examples of automated calculation machines .
People do not want a machine that would do the same thing over and over again .
For example , a music box is a machine that plays the same music over and over again .
Some people wanted to be able to tell their machine to do different things .
For example , they wanted to tell the music box to play different music every time .
They wanted to be able to program the music box- to order the music box to play different music .
This part of computer history is called the `` history of programmable machines '' which is a fancy phrase for `` The history of machines that I can order to do different things if I know how to speak their language . ''
One of the first examples of this was built by Hero of Alexandria ( c. 10–70 AD ) .
He built a mechanical theater which performed a play lasting 10 minutes and was operated by a complex system of ropes and drums .
These ropes and drums were the language of the machine- they told what the machine did and when .
Some people argue that this is the first programmable machine .
Historians disagree on which early machines are `` computers '' .
Many say the `` castle clock '' , an astronomical clock invented by Al-Jazari in 1206 , is the first known programmable analog computer .
The length of day and night could be adjusted every day in order to account for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year .
Some count this daily adjustment as computer programming .
Others say the first computer was made by Charles Babbage .
Ada Lovelace is considered to be the first programmer .
At the end of the Middle Ages , people started thinking math and engineering were more important .
In 1623 , Wilhelm Schickard made a mechanical calculator .
Other Europeans made more calculators after him .
They were not modern computers because they could only add , subtract , and multiply- you could not change what they did to make them do something like play Tetris .
Because of this , we say they were not programmable .
Now engineers use computers to design and plan .
In 1801 , Joseph Marie Jacquard used punched paper cards to tell his textile loom what kind of pattern to weave .
He could use punch cards to tell the loom what to do , and he could change the punch cards , which means he could program the loom to weave the pattern he wanted .
This means the loom was programmable .
Charles Babbage wanted to make a similar machine that could calculate .
He called it `` The Analytical Engine '' .
Because Babbage did not have enough money and always changed his design when he had a better idea , he never built his Analytical Engine .
As time went on , computers were used more .
People get bored easily doing the same thing over and over .
Imagine spending your life writing things down on index cards , storing them , and then having to go find them again .
The U.S. Census Bureau in 1890 had hundreds of people doing just that .
It was expensive , and reports took a long time .
Then an engineer worked out how to make machines do a lot of the work .
Herman Hollerith invented a tabulating machine that would automatically add up information that the Census bureau collected .
The Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation ( which later became IBM ) made his machines .
They leased the machines instead of selling them .
Makers of machines had long helped their users understand and repair them , and CTR 's tech support was especially good .
Because of machines like this , new ways of talking to these machines were invented , and new types of machines were invented , and eventually the computer as we know it was born .
In the first half of the 20th century , scientists started using computers , mostly because scientists had a lot of math to figure out and wanted to spend more of their time thinking about science questions instead of spending hours adding numbers together .
For example , if they had to launch a rocket ship , they needed to do a lot of math to make sure the rocket worked right .
So they put together computers .
These analog computers used analog circuits , which made them very hard to program .
In the 1930s , they invented digital computers , and soon made them easier to program .
However this is not the case as many consecutive attempts have been made to bring arithmetic logic to l3.Analog computers are mechanical or electronic devices which solve problems.Some are used to control machines as well .
Scientists figured out how to make and use digital computers in the 1930s to 1940s .
Scientists made a lot of digital computers , and as they did , they figured out how to ask them the right sorts of questions to get the most out of them .
Here are a few of the computers they built :
Several developers of ENIAC saw its problems .
They invented a way to for a computer to remember what they had told it , and a way to change what it remembered .
This is known as `` stored program architecture '' or von Neumann architecture .
John von Neumann talked about this design in the paper `` First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC '' , distributed in 1945 .
A number of projects to develop computers based on the stored-program architecture started around this time .
The first of these was completed in Great Britain .
The first to be demonstrated working was the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine ( SSEM or `` Baby '' ) , while the EDSAC , completed a year after SSEM , was the first really useful computer that used the stored program design .
Shortly afterwards , the machine originally described by von Neumann 's paper—EDVAC—was completed but was not ready for two years .
Nearly all modern computers use the stored-program architecture .
It has become the main concept which defines a modern computer .
The technologies used to build computers have changed since the 1940s , but many current computers still use the von-Neumann architecture .
In the 1950s computers were built out of mostly vacuum tubes .
Transistors replaced vacuum tubes in the 1960s because they were smaller and cheaper .
They also need less power and do not break down as much as vacuum tubes .
In the 1970s , technologies were based on integrated circuits .
Microprocessors , such as the Intel 4004 made computers smaller , cheaper , faster and more reliable .
By the 1980s , microcontrollers became small and cheap enough to replace mechanical controls in things like washing machines .
The 1980s also saw home computers and personal computers .
With the evolution of the Internet , personal computers are becoming as common as the television and the telephone in the household .
In 2005 Nokia started to call some of its mobile phones ( the N-series ) `` multimedia computers '' and after the launch of the Apple iPhone in 2007 , many are now starting to add the smartphone category among `` real '' computers .
In 2008 , if smartphones are included in the numbers of computers in the world , the biggest computer maker by units sold , was no longer Hewlett-Packard , but rather Nokia .
There are many types of computers .
Some include :
A `` desktop computer '' is a small machine that has a screen ( which is not part of the computer ) .
Most people keep them on top of a desk , which is why they are called `` desktop computers . ''
`` Laptop computers '' are computers small enough to fit on your lap .
This makes them easy to carry around .
Both laptops and desktops are called personal computers , because one person at a time uses them for things like playing music , surfing the web , or playing video games .
There are bigger computers that many people at a time can use .
These are called `` Mainframes , '' and these computers do all the things that make things like the internet work .
You can think of a personal computer like this : the personal computer is like your skin : you can see it , other people can see it , and through your skin you feel wind , water , air , and the rest of the world .
A mainframe is more like your internal organs : you never see them , and you barely even think about them , but if they suddenly went missing , you would have some very big problems .
An embedded computer , also called embedded system is a computer that does one thing and one thing only , and usually does it very well .
For example , an alarm clock is an embedded computer : it tells the time .
Unlike your personal computer , you can not use your clock to play Tetris .
Because of this , we say that embedded computers can not be programmed , because you can not install more programs on your clock .
Some mobile phones , automatic teller machines , microwave ovens , CD players and cars are operated by embedded computers .
All-in-one computers are desktop computers that have all of the computer 's inner mechanisms in the same case as the monitor .
Apple has made several popular examples of all-in-one computers , such as the original Macintosh of the mid-1980s and the iMac of the late 1990s and 2000s .
Computers store data and the instructions as numbers , because computers can do things with numbers very quickly .
These data are stored as binary symbols ( 1s and 0s ) .
A 1 or a 0 symbol stored by a computer is called a bit , which comes from the words binary digit .
Computers can use many bits together to represent instructions and the data that these instructions use .
A list of instructions is called a program and is stored on the computer 's hard disk .
Computers work through the program by using a central processing unit , and they use fast memory called RAM also known as ( Random Access Memory ) as a space to store the instructions and data while they are doing this .
When the computer wants to store the results of the program for later , it uses the hard disk because things stored on a hard disk can still be remembered after the computer is turned off .
An operating system tells the computer how to understand what jobs it has to do , how to do these jobs , and how to tell people the results .
Millions of computers may be using the same operating system , while each computer can have its own application programs to do what its user needs .
Using the same operating systems makes it easy to learn how to use computers for new things .
A user who needs to use a computer for something different , can learn how to use a new application program .
Some operating systems can have simple command lines or a fully user-friendly GUI .
One of the most important jobs that computers do for people is helping with communication .
Communication is how people share information .
Computers have helped people move forward in science , medicine , business , and learning , because they let experts from anywhere in the world work with each other and share information .
They also let other people communicate with each other , do their jobs almost anywhere , learn about almost anything , or share their opinions with each other .
The Internet is the thing that lets people communicate between their computers .
A computer is now almost always an electronic device .
It usually contains materials that will become electronic waste when discarded .
When a new computer is bought in some places , laws require that the cost of its waste management must also be paid for .
This is called product stewardship .
Computers can become obsolete quickly , depending on what programs the user runs .
Very often , they are thrown away within two or three years , because some newer programs require a more powerful computer .
This makes the problem worse , so computer recycling happens a lot .
Many projects try to send working computers to developing nations so they can be re-used and will not become waste as quickly , as most people do not need to run new programs .
Some computer parts , such as hard drives , can break easily .
When these parts end up in the landfill , they can put poisonous chemicals like lead into the ground-water .
Hard drives can also contain secret information like credit card numbers .
If the hard drive is not erased before being thrown away , an identity thief can get the information from the hard drive , even if the drive does n't work , and use it to steal money from the previous owner 's bank account .
Computers come in different forms , but most of them have a common design .
A computer has several main parts .
When comparing a computer to a human body , the CPU is like a brain .
It does most of the thinking and tells the rest of the computer how to work .
The CPU is on the Motherboard , which is like the skeleton .
It provides the basis for where the other parts go , and carries the nerves that connect them to each other and the CPU .
The motherboard is connected to a power supply , which provides electricity to the entire computer .
The various drives ( CD drive , floppy drive , and on many newer computers , USB flash drive ) act like eyes , ears , and fingers , and allow the computer to read different types of storage , in the same way that a human can read different types of books .
The hard drive is like a human 's memory , and keeps track of all the data stored on the computer .
Most computers have a sound card or another method of making sound , which is like vocal cords , or a voice box .
Connected to the sound card are speakers , which are like a mouth , and are where the sound comes out .
Computers might also have a graphics card , which helps the computer to create visual effects , such as 3D environments , or more realistic colors , and more powerful graphics cards can make more realistic or more advanced images , in the same way a well trained artist can .
Chinese
Chinese might mean :
Continent
A continent is a large area of the land on Earth that is joined together .
In general it is agreed there are seven continents in the world : Africa , Antarctica , Asia , Europe , North America , Australia or Oceania , and South America .
The most populous continent by population is Asia followed by Africa .
The third most populous continent is the Americas .
The fourth most populous is Europe and then Oceania .
In sub-Saharan Africa , the largest age group are denarians ( in their teens ) .
In north Africa the largest age group are vicenarian ( in their twenties ) .
In Europe , most people are tricenarian ( in their thirties ) or quadragenarian ( in their forties ) .
Some sources say that Australia is one of the seven continents .
Others say that Australia is part of Oceania .
Oceania is a region which includes Australia , New Zealand and the Pacific Islands .
The third alternative is the term Australasia , which includes at least all countries on the Australian continental plate .
This includes the islands of New Guinea , Tasmania , New Zealand and a number of smaller islands .
It is on the south-eastern side of the Wallace Line , with distinct differences in its biology from the Asian side of the line .
North America and South America are often described as `` the Americas '' .
This has the advantage of including Central America and the Caribbean islands .
Otherwise , Central America is counted as part of North America .
Eurasia is not really an alternative , it is a recognition that the landmass of Europe and Asia are continuous , and some of its largest countries are in both continents .
Russia extends from eastern Europe to the far east of Asia without a break .
The Ural Mountains , which run roughly north/south , are the traditional dividing-line between Europe and Asia .
For many purposes it is convenient to consider the great landmass as a single continent , Eurasia .
When British people talk about `` the Continent '' ( or `` Continental '' things ) they mean the European mainland .
This meaning is not used as much as it used to be , but is still seen in phrases like `` Continental breakfast '' ( rolls with cheese , jam etc .
as distinct from an `` English breakfast '' which is a cooked breakfast ) .
Continents not only move but also sometimes move against each other .
The Indian subcontinent has been colliding with the Eurasian continent for a while now .
As these continents push against each other , they buckle and bend .
Because of this , the Himalaya Mountains , where Mount Everest is , are still being made today .
Zealandia is an almost entirely submerged land mass , and 93 % of it still remains under water .
Zealandia may have broken off the Australian plate between 85 and 130 million years ago .
Classical element
The Greek classical elements are fire , air , water , and earth .
In Greek philosophy , science and medicine , these make up a whole .
The image below has two squares on top of each other .
The corners of one are the classical elements .
The corners of the other are the properties .
Galen said these elements were used by Hippocrates to describe the human body .
The elements are linked to the four humours : phlegm ( water ) , yellow bile ( fire ) , black bile ( earth ) , and blood ( air ) .
In Chinese Taoism the elements are metal , wood , water , fire , earth ( ) .
China
China ( Pinyin : Zhōngguó ) is a cultural region , an ancient civilization , and a nation in East Asia .
The last Chinese Civil War ( 19271949 ) resulted in two different political powers today :
China is one of the world 's oldest civilizations : it has the oldest continuous civilization .
There is archaeological evidence over 5,000 years old .
China also has one of the world 's oldest writing systems ( and the oldest in use today ) .
China has been the source of many major inventions .
The first recorded use of the word `` China '' is dated 1555 .
It is derived from `` chīnī '' , a Persian adjective meaning 'Chinese ' which was popularized in Europe by Marco Polo .
Ancient China was one of the first civilizations and was active since the 2nd millennium BC as a feudal society .
Chinese civilization was also one of the few to invent writing , with the others being Mesopotamia , the Indus Valley civilization , the Maya civilization , the Minoan civilization of ancient Greece , and Ancient Egypt .
It reached its golden age during the Tang Dynasty ( c. A.D. 10th century ) .
Home of Confucianism and Daoism , it had great influence on nearby countries including Japan , Korea , and Vietnam in the areas of political system , philosophy , religion , art , writing and literature .
China is home to some of the oldest artwork in the world .
Statues and pottery , as well as decorations made of jade , are some classic examples .
Before the Qin Dynasty united China , there were hundreds of small states that fought each other for hundreds of years in a war to control China .
This is known as the Warring States Period .
Although the continuing wars made people suffer , it was at this time when many great philosophies were born , including Confucianism and Daoism .
Confucianism and Daoism alone have been the foundation of many social values seen in modern eastern-Asian cultures today .
Its geography mostly looked like that of modern China , except with northern and western edges that varied .
It was often attacked by northern nomadic people such as the Turkic peoples and the Mongols led by Genghis Khan and Kublai Khan .
During the history of ancient China , the northern nomadic people and the Chinese people had been fighting each other and taking turns to rule the land and the people of China .
However , when the northern people beat the Chinese people and came to rule the kingdom , they also Incorporated the Chinese way of living and became like the Chinese .
Many of the strongest dynasties of China were ruled by the northern people , including the Qin , Tang , Yuan ( Mongolian ) , and Qing .
Each time , they also brought new elements into the Chinese culture .
While China achieved many things in the First millennium and early 2nd millennium , it became an isolationist country in the 15th century C.E .
This was because Spain found enormous silver in the new continent , which was the main currency ( money ) in China and Europe at the time , and China did not want to be bought by the foreigners .
By the time of the Renaissance , European powers started to take over other countries in Asia .
While China was never actually taken over , many European countries , such as Britain and France built spheres of influence in China .
Since China had cut itself off from the world over the previous few centuries , by the Qing Dynasty , it had fallen behind other countries in technology , and was helpless to stop this from happening .
This had become clear when it lost the Opium Wars to Britain in the 19th century .
Still influenced by Western sources , China faced internal strife .
The Taiping Rebellion or Taiping War occurred in China from 1851 through 1864 .
The Taiping Rebellion was led by Hong Xiuquan from Guangdon .
Hong Xiuquan was influenced by Christian missionaries and declared himself the brother of Jesus .
Hong made his mission to bring down the Qing Dynasty .
Gaining influence on the southern Chinese population , the Taiping Rebellion attracted tens of thousands of supporters .
The Taiping regime successfully created a state within the Qing Empire with the capital at Nanjing .
Hong called his new state the Taiping Tianguo or `` The Heavenly State of Great Peace '' .
Local armies eventually suppressed the rebellion at the final battle of Nanjing .
In 1911 , the Republic of China was founded by Sun Yat-sen , but its government was very weak .
Warlords controlled many areas .
Chiang Kai-shek led wars against them , and he became President and dictator .
In 1931 , Japan invaded Manchuria , a place in the northeastern part of China .
On July 7 , 1937 , the Japanese attacked the rest of the country , starting what was called the Second Sino-Japanese War .
The war later became part of World War II .
The war was fought for eight years and millions of Chinese people were killed .
However , the Chinese Civil War later started between the Kuomintang ( Nationalists ) of the Republic of China ( ROC ) and the Communists of the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) .
The Communists wanted to make China like the Soviet Union , whereas the other side wanted to keep China in its current state at the time .
The Communists were led by Mao Zedong , Liu Shaoqi and others .
Later Liu lost influence with Mao and his death to this day remains unresolved .
The Communists eventually won the war .
The Nationalists ( led by Chiang Kai-shek ) fled to the island of Taiwan and set up their new capital city in Taipei .
After the Chinese Civil War , the Communist leader Mao Zedong declared a new country , the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) , in Beijing on October 1 , 1949 .
Under Mao the country stayed poor while Taiwan became richer .
His attempt at industrialization and collectivization with the Great Leap Forward led to the deaths of many people from famine .
The Cultural Revolution caused great social upheaval .
After 1976 , China underwent market economy reforms under Deng Xiaoping , and experienced rapid economic growth .
China is now one of the largest economies in the world , relying mainly on exports .
In recent history , China has had problems with protests , blocking of information on the Internet , and censorship of news .
1989 was notable for the controversial Tian An Men Massacre .
China 's landscape is vast and diverse .
It ranges from the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts in the north to subtropical forests in the south .
The Himalaya , Karakoram , Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from much of South and Central Asia .
The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern coast .
The Yangtze River is the third-longest river in the world while the Yellow River is the sixth-longest .
China 's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 kilometers ( 9,000 mi ) long .
It is bounded by the Bohai , Yellow , East China and South China seas .
China connects through the Kazakh border to the Eurasian Steppe .
The Eurasian Steppe has been an artery of communication between East and West since the Neolithic through the Steppe route .
The Steppe Route is the ancestor of the terrestrial Silk Road ( s ) .
China 's constitution states that The People 's Republic of China `` is a socialist state under the people 's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants '' .
It also states the state organs `` apply the principle of democratic centralism . ''
The PRC is one of the world 's only socialist states openly being communist .
With 2.3 million active troops , the People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) is the largest standing military force in the world .
The PLA is commanded by the Central Military Commission ( CMC ) .
China has the second-biggest military reserve force , only behind North Korea .
The PLA consists of the Ground Force ( PLAGF ) , the Navy ( PLAN ) , the Air Force ( PLAAF ) , and the People 's Liberation Army Rocket Force ( PLARF ) .
According to the Chinese government , China 's military budget for 2017 was US $ 151,5 billion .
China has the world 's second-largest military budget .
China was once a world leader in science and technology up until the Ming dynasty .
There are many Ancient Chinese discoveries and inventions .
For example , papermaking , printing , the compass , and gunpowder are known as the Four Great Inventions .
They became widespread across East Asia , the Middle East and later to Europe .
Chinese mathematicians were the first to use negative numbers .
By the 17th century , Europe and the Western world became better than China in science and technology .
The national census of 2010 recorded the population of the People 's Republic of China to be about 1,370,536,875 .
About 16.60 % of the population were 14 years old or younger , 70.14 % were between 15 and 59 years old , and 13.26 % were over 60 years old .
The population growth rate for 2013 is estimated to be 0.46 % .
China is the origin of Eastern martial arts , called Kung Fu or its first name Wushu .
China is also the home of the well-respected Spa Monastery and Wudang Mountains .
Martial art started more for the purpose of survival , defense , and warfare than art .
Over time some art forms have branched off , while others have retained their distinct Chinese flavor .
China has had renowned artists including Wong Fei Hung ( Huang Fei Hung or Hwang Fei Hung ) and many others .
Art has also co-existed with a variety of paints including the more standard 18 colors .
Legendary and controversial moves like Big Mak are also praised and talked about within the culture .
China has many traditional festivals , such as Spring Festival , Dragon Boat Festival , Mid-autumn Festival and so on .
The most important is Chinese New Year .
People in China will have holidays to celebrate these festivals .
Spring Festival is the Chinese New Year .
Dragon Boat Festival is celebrated to commemorate the death of Qu Yuan , a patriotic poet of the State of Chu during the Warring States period .
He persuaded his emperor not to accept Qin 's diplomats ' offers several times but his emperor did not listen to him .
He was very sad and ended up jumping into the river to end his life .
The people loved him so much that they did not want the fish to eat his corpse .
They made and threw rice dumplings into the river .
They hope the fish eat these dumplings instead of the poet 's corpse .
They also rowed dragon boats in the river to get rid of the fish .
Such practices , eating rice dumplings and holding dragon boat races , become what Chinese do in this festival nowadays .
Held on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month , Mid-Autumn Festival is a festival for families .
Now when the festival sets in , people would sit together to eat moon cakes , appreciate the bright full moon cakes , appreciate the bright full moon , celebrate the bumper harvest and enjoy the family love and happiness .
To the Chinese people , the full moon symbolizes family reunion , as does the `` moon cakes . ''
Hence the Mid-Autumn Festival is also called the Family Reunion Festival .
Country
As defined by Montevideo Convention , a country is a territory with distinct political boundaries that claims sovereignty over a specific geographic area with a permanent population , controlled by its own government that enters relations with other states .
There is no universally accepted answer as to how many countries in the world there actually are , however the minimum answer is 193 for the 193 United Nations members .
This number can become bigger in other ways .
For example , there are two United Nations observer states .
The Vatican City State and the State of Palestine .
This would add two to the list of United Nations member states , there for the number of countries the would be 195 .
Taiwan is also sometimes classified as a country .
However , there is an ongoing disputes over Taiwan 's sovereignty with the People 's Republic of China .
This can be developed on even further by adding the constituent countries of the United Kingdom , The Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of Denmark which could add anywhere from three to eleven countries to the prior number .
There are a number of disputed areas that have declared independence from their parent state and receive limited recognition .
For example , Kosovo , South Ossetia , Transnistria and Abkhazia .
These are just some of the many examples of terrirories with limited to no recognition that are sometimes classed as countries .
There is a lot of controversy surrounding the above examples and quite often any one of these territories may be counted as countries purely based on opinion .
If all of the above were added the list of U.N members there could be anything up to 211 countries based on the previous examples given .
There are however many more territories with unique political circumstances that could also be counted .
Depending on how loosely the dictionary definition for the word country is used there could be anything from 193 countries in the world or more .
The matter is purely subjective depending on varying opinions and there has never been any consideration as to what the maximum number of countries in the world could be .
There are multiple organisations that have their own lists of countries , one example being the Travellers Century Club which recognises 327 countries as of 01/01/18 .
Constituent country is a term sometimes used , usually by official institutions , in contexts in which a number of countries compose a long entity or grouping .
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) has used the term referring to the former Yugoslavia , and the European institutions like the Council of Europe often use it in reference to the European Union .
A disputed territory is that territory whose sovereignty is jealously desired by two or more countries .
Usually the administration of the territory is carried out by one of the countries that claims sovereignty , while the other country does not recognize the sovereignty over the territory of the other country .
This does not usually happen in land or sea areas on which none possesses effective control , such as Antarctica , or only partially .
It can also be considered as a disputed territory to those areas that are given by two different governments , and therefore are divided .
One example is the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and Cyprus .
Colchester
Colchester is a town in the northern part of the English county of Essex .
It has a population of 104,000 people .
People believe that Colchester is the oldest Roman town in England .
Before Roman times , Colchester was `` Camulodunon '' .
This is a Celtic name that came from Camulos .
Camulos was the Celtic god of war .
The Romans called Colchester `` Camulodunum '' ( written `` CAMVLODVNVM '' ) and made it the capital of Roman Britain .
Colchester was attacked and burnt by Boudicca in 61 AD .
The Romans moved their capital of Britannia to Londinium ( now London ) , but Camulodunum remained an important city until the fifth century , when the Saxons conquered the region .
The Roman town of `` Camulodunum '' , officially known as `` Colonia Victricensis '' , reached its peak in the Second and Third centuries AD .
It may have reached a population of 30,000 in those centuries , but when the Romans withdrew from Britannia in 410 AD it probably had fewer than 5,000 inhabitants .
The church at the Benedictine abbey of Saint John the Baptist was destroyed in 1539 .
This action was part of the dissolution of the monasteries by King Henry VIII .
Only a gate remains , that people still go to visit .
King Cunobelinus ( or `` Cunobelin '' ) was from Colchester .
Colchester is twinned with the following cities :
Cartography
Cartography is making maps .
It is part of geography .
How people make maps is always changing .
In the past , maps were drawn by hand , but today most printed maps are made using computers and people usually see maps on computer screens .
Someone who makes maps is called a cartographer .
Making a map can be as simple as drawing a direction on a napkin , or as complicated as showing a whole country or world .
Anyone can make a map , but cartographers spend their lives learning how to make better maps .
For many centuries maps were usually carefully drawn onto paper or parchment .
Now they are made on a computer which makes them look neater with accurate images .
Maps are of two main types :
General maps are produced in a series .
Governments produce them in larger-scale and smaller-scale maps of great detail .
Thematic maps are now very common .
They are necessary to show spatial , cultural and social data .
Creator
A creator is a person who creates something .
In some religions ( Judaism , Christianity , Islam ) God ( or Allah meaning the God in Arabic ) is the most important and original creator of the whole universe - including Man who is made `` in his image '' ( see Genesis ) to observe it and control it like God .
The idea that anything that a person is creating , like an idea , can be owned as property comes from the ethical traditions and legal codes that came from these religions .
In other traditions ( Buddhism , Native American mythology ) anyone has this potential for creating , and can become part of the greater creating of the universe .
Stewardship of home , land and all of Earth is a test for participating in this , or just good sense .
Contact network
Contact network may mean :
Chorizo
Chorizo is a pork ( pig-meat ) sausage which people first made in the Iberian Peninsula .
It is made with large pieces of fatty pork , chili pepper and paprika .
The special taste of this sausage comes from the mild Spanish paprika in it .
In the western hemisphere , the Mexican and Caribbean types are better known .
These types of chorizo are made with smaller pieces of pork and different seasonings and peppers are used .
Cured smoked chorizo is edible and can be eaten without cooking .
Fresh chorizo must be cooked before eating .
It can be eaten by its self , or as part of meal .
It can also be used in place of ground beef or pork .
Creativity
Creativity is the ability of a person or group to make something new and useful or valuable , or the process of making something new and useful or valuable .
It happens in all areas of life - science , art , literature and music .
As a personal ability it is very difficult to measure .
The reason is that we do n't understand the mental processes that help some people be more creative than others .
Judging what is creative is also controversial .
Some people say only things which are historically new are creative , while other people say that if it is new for the creator and the people around them , then it is also creativity .
Some think that creativity is an important thing that makes humans different from apes .
Others recognize that even apes , other primates , other mammals and some birds adapt to survive by being creative ( for example - primates using tools ) .
Liane Gabora believes that all culture comes from creativity , not imitation .
Therefore , these people say , human science should focus on it ( pay special attention to it ) : Ethics for example would focus on finding creative solutions to ethical dilemmas .
Politics would focus on the political virtues that need some creativity .
Imitation would not be the focus of education .
Linguistics might be more interested in how new words are created by culture , rather than in how existing ones are used in grammar .
Intellectual interests ( recognized as intellectual rights or intellectual property in the law ) are a way to reward creativity in law , but they do not always work very well .
A good example is copyright which is supposed to pay authors and artists , but may only pay lawyers to make ( imitative ) arguments in court .
Creativity is a central question in economics , where it is known as ingenuity ( the ability to come up with new ideas ) or individual capital - capacities that individuals have , that do not arise from simple imitation of what is known already .
This is separate from the instructional capital that might try to capture some of that in a patent or training system that helps others do what the individual leader or founder of the system can do .
In urban economics there are various ways to measure creativity - the Bohemian Index and Gay Index are two attempts to do this accurately and predict the economic growth of cities based on creativity .
Catharism
The Cathar faith was a version of Christianity .
They were usually considered Gnostics .
The word 'Cathar ' comes the Greek word `` katharos '' meaning 'unpolluted ' ( from Tobias Churton , `` The Gnostics '' ) or `` the pure ones '' .
The Cathars believed that the world had been made by a bad god .
They believed that this bad god had taken them from the good god and put them in the world , but inside their bodies there was a spirit , and that spirit needed to return to the good god .
They were famous for a belief in a form of reincarnation and believed that when someone died the bad god would put that person 's spirit in a new body .
They believed this cycle of coming back to life could be escaped by a ritual cleansing .
They were opposed to the doctrine of sin .
Women were prominent in the faith .
They were pacifists .
They did n't eat anything that was made from other animals , including meat and cows milk .
The only exception to this was fish .
Fish was OK to eat because they believed fishes were not alive but just things that were sometimes produced from dirt and water .
They preached tolerance of other faiths .
They rejected the usual Christian rules of marriage and only believed in the New Testament .
An earlier 10th-century Bulgarian heresy , Bogomilism and also Manichaeism started some of these trends .
They used a bible in the language people spoke .
Many other Christians used a Bible in Latin .
Latin was spoken only by the priests .
In 1145 , open challenge to Catholic dominance began .
In about 1165 , the first Cathars said that the Church was `` full of ravening ( starving ) wolves and hypocrites '' and `` worshipping the wrong God '' , right in front of the most powerful Catholics .
In 1166 , the Council of Oxford in England wiped out the English Cathars .
It was also suppressed in Northern France .
In 1167 , Cathar bishops met to discuss organizing a counter Church - in the South of France , the Languedoc nobles protected it , and many noble women became `` Perfects '' .
Parish clergy had low morale , or confidence .
The Catholic Church was against Catharism , seeing it as a heresy .
In the South of France there was tremendous religious fervor , and an economy that was starting to grow , and a social class of merchants and peasants was starting to grow .
Peasants owned their own land .
Meanwhile , in other parts of Europe , peasants were forced to give up their land to nobles and become serfs or slaves - the system of feudalism .
There was a strong central absolute monarchy that did not exist in the South of France .
The burghers and bankers had more power in this looser system .
R. I. Moore is a historian who believes that it was desire to crush this system and take over the land that drove the attack .
However , there was real cultural and religious difference to cause problems : Troubadors , who combined some of the traditions of the Bards of the Celts , and Jews , were both part of the multicultural society in the South of France .
Their influences were not appreciated by local or Roman Church figures .
The 12th century Roman Catholic Monks were founding their monasteries outside the towns , drawing the best people there .
The Cathars thus had little competition .
The Cathar `` Perfects '' , the so-called Good Men or Good Women , lived restrained lives and spread their faith in towns - where the Catholics in general did not have their best agents .
Also , Cathars preached that only these Good leaders had to follow the regimens their whole lives - lay people could repent only on their deathbeds .
Many 20th century Christian sects have similar beliefs .
The Pope ordered a crusade against the Cathars in southern France .
He said any crusader who answered the call would be given the same rewards as a crusader who went to the Holy Land .
This was an absolution of all sin .
In the Launguedoc , on the 22nd of July 1209 , a force of about 30,000 Crusaders arrived at the walls of Beziers bearing the cross pattee to mislead and create ease among the Cathars , thinking they were friend , not foe , and demanded that about 200 Cathars be surrendered .
The people of the town who were mostly Catholic , said that rather than turn over their friends and family , `` we would rather be flayed alive . ''
A mistake by the defenders of Beziers let thousands of attackers in .
Arnauld Amaury made the famous quote `` Kill them all , god knows his own '' on being asked how to tell who were Cathars during the assault .
Everyone in the town was killed , some while taking refuge in the church .
It is guessed that 20,000 were killed , many of whom were Catholics and not Cathars at all .
The crusade became known as the Albigensian crusade after the town of Albi .
It was to wipe out the Cathars almost entirely over forty or so years .
The Crusaders wanted to go home , but were ordered by the Pope to continue until the whole South of France was controlled and all Cathars were dead .
In 1210 , they attacked the fortress at Minerv and built `` the first great bonfire of heretics '' - beginning the practice of burning at the stake that would continue in the Inquisition of the Counter-Reformation .
It is interesting to note that at the siege of Montsegur when the fires were lit the Cathars ran down the hill and threw themselves on , as their beliefs were very strong .
Catharism disappeared from the northern Italian cities after the 1260s , pressured by the Inquisition .
The last known Cathar perfectus in the Languedoc , Guillaume Bélibaste , was killed in 1321 .
Cosmology
Cosmology is the branch of astronomy that deals with the origin , structure , evolution and space-time relationships of the universe .
NASA defines cosmology as `` The study of the structure and changes in the present universe '' .
Another definition of cosmology is `` the study of the universe , and humanity 's place in it '' .
Modern cosmology is dominated by the Big Bang theory , which brings together observational astronomy and particle physics .
Though the word `` cosmology '' is recent ( first used in 1730 in Christian Wolff 's `` Cosmologia Generalis '' ) , the study of the universe has a long history .
Until recently , people thought that the universe was the Milky Way .
They thought this because they could only see the planets up to Saturn and stars .
With the invention of the telescope , our universe got bigger .
Even in the 20th century , people thought that the Milky Way was the universe .
With the Hubble Space Telescope , people could see things far away .
Church (building)
The information that follows applies mostly to the historical practice of the Church of England .
A church is a building that was constructed to allow people to meet to worship together .
These people are usually Christians , or influenced by Christianity .
Some other religious groups also call their religious buildings churches .
Depending on the number of people that are in a community , the churches come in different sizes .
Small churches are called chapels .
The churches in a particular geographical area form a group called the diocese .
Each diocese has a cathedral .
In most cases , the cathedral is a very big church .
Cathedrals are the seat of bishops .
In the early days of Christianity people had to worship in secret .
Christian worship was not allowed in the Roman empire , so Christians had to meet in a secret place .
Sometimes they met in people ’ s houses or barns , sometimes they met underground .
The first places that were built for Christian worship were small chapels that were cut into a rock where people could worship without being discovered .
After the death of the Roman emperor Constantine in 337 A.D. Christians were allowed to have buildings to worship in .
These first churches were built on a similar plan to Roman basilicas .
This plan was later used for the fine Gothic cathedrals and churches that were built at the end of the Middle Ages .
There are several parts in the architecture of a church .
Not all churches will have all these parts :
In Roman Catholic churches there is always a stoup ( bowl ) of holy water near the entrance of the church .
This tradition comes from the fact that Roman basilicas had a fountain for washing in front of the entrance .
The font is a bowl where people ( often babies ) are baptized .
This is also near the entrance of the church .
This is a symbol of the fact that it is welcoming the people into the Christian church .
Traditionally the nave has long benches for the congregation to sit on .
These are called pews .
Some churches may now have replaced their pews with chairs so that they can be moved about for different occasions .
At the front of the nave is the pulpit where the priest preaches ( these talks are called “ sermons ” ) .
There is also a lectern ( like a large music stand ) from where the lessons ( the Bible readings ) are read .
If there are aisles along the side of the nave there will be pillars which hold up the roof .
In large churches or cathedrals there may be a row of little arches along the top of these pillars .
This is called the triforium .
Over the triforium is the clerestory which is a row of windows high up in the church wall .
The chancel is the most holy part of the church , and this is why it is often separated from the nave by a screen which can be made of wood or stone , or occasionally iron .
The congregation can see through the screen .
On the top of the screen there may be a cross .
This is called a rood ( pronounce like “ rude ” ) screen .
Priests used to climb up a staircase to the top of the rood screen to read the epistle and the gospel .
Sometimes people sang from there .
Inside the chancel are the benches where the choir sit .
These are called choir stalls .
They are on both sides .
The two sides of the choir sit facing one another .
The choir members who sit on the left ( north side ) are called “ cantoris ” ( the side where the “ cantor ” sits ) and those on the right ( south side ) are called “ decani ” ( the side where the deacon sits ) .
In some large churches or cathedrals the seats for the priests tip up .
The top of these seats , when they are tipped up , are called misericords ( from the Latin word for “ mercy ” ) .
This is because the priests or monks were able to lean against them when they got tired if they had to stand up for a long time .
Sometimes there are holes in the walls of the screen so that the congregation can see through .
These are called squints .
If there is a recess in the wall it is called an aumbry .
It is a cupboard for communion wine and bread that have been consecrated by a priest .
The altar may be right at the east end of the church , but in larger churches or cathedrals it is often much farther forward .
In that case the very east end is called an apse .
Sometimes it is a separate chapel called the “ Lady Chapel ” .
The design of churches changed a lot during the course of history .
Often churches were made bigger .
When this happened there may be a mixture of architectural styles .
These styles vary a lot in different countries .
In English churches there were several different periods of architecture :
In the 1600s , churches were built in a variety of styles .
Often they copied some of the older styles .
After the Great Fire of London many new churches were built by the architect Sir Christopher Wren .
They were built in the classical style .
Churches continued to be built in later centuries like this , but also the Gothic style continued to be used .
Modern churches often do not have the traditional cross-shape .
It is difficult for the congregation to see and hear what is happening in the chancel .
Modern churches bring the congregation , choir and priests in closer touch .
An example is the round design for the Church of Christ the Cornerstone in Milton Keynes .
Modern churches are often simpler but with a warmer character than the Gothic churches .
Many have beautiful mosaic glass windows .
Coventry Cathedral is a famous example of a modern church building .
City
A city is a place where many people live together .
A city has many buildings and streets .
It has houses or apartments for many people to live , shops where they may buy things , places for people to work and a government organisation to run the city , and to keep law and order in the city .
People live in cities because it is easy for them to find and do the things they want there .
A city usually has a `` city centre '' where government and business take place , and places called suburbs where people live around the outside of the centre .
There is no rule that is used all over the world to decide why some places are called `` city '' and other places are called `` town '' .
Some things that make a city are :
In American English , people often call all places where many people live cities .
( See below : Size of cities )
The sizes of cities can be very different .
This depends on the type of city that it is .
Cities that were built hundreds of years ago and which have not changed much , are very much smaller than modern cities .
There are two main reasons .
One reason is that old cities often have a city wall , and most of the city is inside it .
Another important reason is that the streets in old cities are often narrow .
If the city got too big , it was hard for a cart carrying food to get to the market place .
People in cities need food , and the food always has to come from outside the city .
Cities that were on a river like London could grow much bigger than cities that were on a mountain like Sienna in Italy , because the river made a transport route for carrying food and other goods , as well as for transporting people .
London has been changing continually for hundreds of years , while Siena , which was a very important city in the 1300s has changed very little in 700 years .
Modern cities with modern transport systems can grow very large , because the streets are wide enough for cars , buses and trucks , and there are often railway lines as well .
In the US , the word city is often used for towns that are not very big .
When the first European people went to America , they gave the name `` city '' to new places .
They hoped the places would be great cities in the future .
For example , Salt Lake City was the name given to a village of 148 people .
When they started building the town they made street plans and called it Great Salt Lake City ( for the nearby Great Salt Lake ) .
Now , 150 years later , it really is a big city .
In modern times many cities have grown bigger and bigger .
The whole area is often called a `` '' metropolis '' '' and can sometimes includes several small ancient towns and villages .
The `` metropolis '' of London includes the City of London , the City of Westminster and many old villages such as Notting Hill , Southwark , Richmond , Greenwich and etc .
The part that is officially known as the `` City of London '' only takes up one square mile .
The rest is known as `` Greater London '' .
Many other cities have grown in the same way .
These giant cities can be exciting places to live , and many people can find good jobs there , but modern cities also have many problems .
Many people can not find jobs in the cities and have to get money by begging or by crime .
Cars , factories , and waste create a lot of pollution that makes people sick .
the smallest city is Urban history
Urban History is history of civilization .
The first cities were made in ancient times , as soon as people began to create civilization .
Famous ancient cities which fell to ruins included Babylon , Troy , Mycenae and Mohenjo Daro .
Benares in northern India is one among the ancient cities which has a history of more 3000 years .
Other cities that have existed since ancient times are Athens in Greece , Rome and Volterra in Italy , Alexandria in Egypt and York in England .
In Europe , in the Middle Ages , being a city was a special privilege , granted by nobility .
Cities that fall into this category , usually had ( or still have ) city walls .
The people who lived in the city were privileged over those who did not .
Medieval cities that still have walls include Carcassonne in France , Tehran in Iran , Toledo in Spain and Canterbury in England .
In the United Kingdom , a city is a town which people have always called a city , or which has got the name `` city '' status by royal charter ( a special paper from the king or queen ) .
Cities usually get this because they have a special number of people or are important .
In the past , cities got that name if they had a cathedral or a university .
Some cathedral cities , for example St David 's , are small , and people do not normally think of them as cities .
Cities that became cities because of their university generally grow because more people move there to be educated at the university colleges .
The university cities of Oxford and Cambridge are famous throughout the world .
The largest city is Shanghai , while the fastest growing is Dubai .
The smallest city in the UK is Wells .
These cities have more than 10 million people :
Cooking
Cooking is a process to make food ready to eat by heating it .
Cooking can kill bacteria that may be in the food .
Raw food is food that is not cooked .
Some foods are good to eat raw .
Other foods are not good for the body when they are raw , so they must be cooked .
Some foods are good to eat either raw or cooking .
Cooking is often done in a kitchen using a stove or an oven .
It can also be done over a fire ( for example , over a campfire or on a barbecue ) .
The heat for cooking can be made in different ways .
It can be from an open fire that burns wood or charcoal .
It can be on a stove or in an oven that uses propane , natural gas , or electricity .
There are several different ways to cook food .
Boiling cooks food in hot water .
Frying ( deep or shallow ) cooks food in hot butter , fat or oil .
Baking and roasting cook food by surrounding it with hot air .
Grilling means cooking food on a metal grill that has heat under it .
People often cook meat by boiling , roasting , frying , or grilling it .
Some foods such as bread or pastries are usually baked .
Usually food is cooked in some kind of pot or pan .
Sometimes people cook food by putting it directly into the fire , or by wrapping the food in leaves before they put it into the fire .
A person whose job it is to cook food may be called a `` cook '' or a `` chef '' .
The word `` cooker '' means a machine or tool that a cook might use to cook food .
Rice cookers and pressure cookers are examples .
Chat
To chat is to talk about ordinary things that are not very important .
A person can chat with another person , or to many people .
People also use this word now for parts of the Internet where we can talk with many different people at the same time .
Usually , people chat on the Internet in a chat room or messaging service like AOL Instant Messenger ( AIM ) , Yahoo Messenger Windows Live Messenger or Tencent QQ .
There are also programs which let people use different messaging services from one program , such as Pidgin .
Cup
A cup is any kind of container used for holding liquid and drinking .
These include :
Cup may also mean :
Crime
A crime ( or misdemeanor or felony ) is an act done by a person which is against the laws of a country or region .
A person who does this is called a criminal .
The basic idea of what things are called `` crimes '' is that they are thought to be things that might cause a problem for another person .
Things like killing another person , injuring another person , or stealing from another person are crimes in most countries .
Also , it can be a crime to have or sell contraband such as guns or illegal drugs .
When some criminals make money from crime , they try to stop the police finding out where the money came from by money laundering .
Men and boys commit many more crimes than women and girls .
There are various levels of crimes .
In some jurisdictions they are :
Different countries have different ideas of what things are crimes , and which ones are the worst .
Some things that are crimes in one country are not crimes in other countries .
Many countries get their ideas of what things are crimes from religions or controversial events which cause a law to be quickly created .
For example , a religious Taboo might say eating a particular food is a crime .
When automobiles became numerous , they killed or hurt many people in road accidents , so new laws were made for them .
In many countries , if people say they made or wrote a book , movie , song , or Web page that they did not really make or write , it is a crime against copyright laws .
In many countries , helping to grow , make , move , or sell illegal drugs is a crime .
In most countries , police try to stop crimes and to find criminals .
When the police find someone who they think might be a criminal , they usually hold the person in a jail .
Then , usually , a court or a judge decides if the person really did a crime .
If the court or judge decides that the person really did it , then he or she might have to pay a fine or go to prison .
Sometimes the judge might decide that the criminal should be executed ( killed ) .
This is called Capital punishment ( or the `` Death Penalty '' ) .
There are countries in the world that execute criminals , and others that do not .
In many countries , two conditions must exist for an act to be criminal :
Both must be present for the act to be considered a crime .
Time Cube
Time Cube is a website created by Gene Ray .
On that website , Dr. Ray explains his `` Time Cube '' theory , which describes the planet Earth as having a cubic symmetry , and time as rotating four `` corners '' .
He also says that all of modern physics is wrong .
Scientists reject these ideas , saying that they make no sense and can not be tested .
The Time Cube website is written in an angry and hateful voice .
On his site , Ray says that anyone who does not believe in Time Cube is `` stupid and evil '' .
Some of the comments are racist and discriminatory , especially against black people and Jews .
There are also many comments against gay people .
