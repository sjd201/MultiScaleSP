A common theory is that it comes from the Latin word `` aperire '' , meaning `` to open '' , referring to flowers opening in spring .
Another theory is that the name could come from Aphrodite , the Greek goddess of love .

August
August ( Aug. ) is the eighth month of the year in the Gregorian calendar , coming between July and September .
It has 31 days , the same number of days as the previous month , July , and is named after Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar .
August does n't begin on the same day of the week as any other month in common years , but begins on the same day of the week as February in leap years .
August always ends on the same day of the week as November .
This month was first called `` Sextilis '' in Latin , because it was the sixth month in the old Roman calendar .
The Roman calendar began in March about 735 BC with Romulus .
October was the eighth month .
August was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King Numa Pompilius about 700 BC .
Or , when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the decemvirs about 450 BC ( Roman writers disagree ) .
